Warning: this clone is not automatically updated.

The master branch is created as follows:

1. install git-hg from https://github.com/offbytwo/git-hg
2. git hg clone https://code.google.com/p/html5lib

Please, do NOT commit file called 'README' into the master branch only to
get github to display its contents automatically. The intent is to keep
master branch equal to original mercurial version.
