Git clone of https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/

Warning: this clone is not automatically updated.

The master branch is created as follows:

git clone git://repo.or.cz/fast-export.git
hg clone https://code.google.com/p/html5lib/ html5lib.hg
git init html5lib.git
cd html5lib.git
../fast-export/hg-fast-export.sh -r ../html5lib.hg
git checkout HEAD

Please, do NOT commit file called 'README' into the master branch only to
get github to display its contents automatically. The intent is to keep
master branch equal to original mercurial version.
